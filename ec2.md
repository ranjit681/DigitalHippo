**12. What is IAM federation?**
    - **Answer:** IAM federation allows you to integrate your existing identity system with AWS, enabling users to access AWS resources using their existing credentials. This can be achieved through federation services like AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) or third-party identity providers.

**13. What is the IAM policy evaluation logic?**
    - **Answer:** IAM policy evaluation follows the "deny by default" principle. If there are no policies explicitly allowing an action, it is denied. Policies can be attached to users, groups, roles, or resources. The most specific policy (with the least privilege) is applied.

**14. How do you create a custom IAM policy?**
    - **Answer:** To create a custom IAM policy, you can do so through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You write the policy in JSON format, specifying the actions, resources, and conditions. Once created, you can attach it to users, groups, or roles.

**15. What is IAM condition element in a policy?**
    - **Answer:** Conditions in IAM policies allow you to control when a policy is in effect. They are expressed as key-value pairs, and they can be used to limit access based on various factors such as time, source IP, and more.

**16. How do you rotate access keys for an IAM user?**
    - **Answer:** You can rotate access keys for an IAM user by creating a new access key, updating applications or services to use the new key, and then deleting the old access key. This ensures a seamless transition without interrupting access.

**17. What is IAM policy versioning?**
    - **Answer:** IAM policy versioning allows you to have multiple versions of a policy. When you update a policy, AWS creates a new version while keeping the old versions intact. This enables you to maintain backward compatibility and roll back changes if needed.

**18. How can you monitor IAM events and activities?**
    - **Answer:** You can monitor IAM events and activities by enabling AWS CloudTrail, which records all API calls made on your account. CloudTrail logs can be analyzed to track IAM activities and events.

**19. What is AWS Organizations and how does it relate to IAM?**
    - **Answer:** AWS Organizations is a service that allows you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. It helps you consolidate billing, apply policies across accounts, and simplify management. IAM is used within each individual account, while AWS Organizations provides management at the organizational level.

**20. How do you troubleshoot IAM permission issues?**
